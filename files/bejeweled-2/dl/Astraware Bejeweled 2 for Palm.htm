<p>Use an extractor program such as <b><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A></b> or <b><A HREF="http://www.stuffit.com">Stuffit Expander</A></b> to get at the Bejeweled 2 files. </P>

<P>Install the game by double-clicking the <i>.prc</i> file, which opens the Palm <I>Install Tool</I> or <I>Quick Install</I> program.</p>

<P>If one is available, users with Palm OS&reg; 5 devices may wish to install the music file as well.  Double click on the <I>.pdb</I> file (or files, if there is more than one) to install it in the same way as installing the <I>.prc</I> file.  Please note that not all Palm OS&reg; 5 handhelds support music, for more information please refer to our knowledgebase <A HREF="http://www.astraware.com/help/showQuestion.php?id=88" target=_new>here.</A></P>

<p>Use the <b>HotSync</b> button as usual to install the game onto your handheld. If you have a handheld with an expansion card, you can then move the game over to it. Do this before you register the game!</p>

<p>Now run <b>Bejeweled 2</b> and tap the screen to play the game!</p>
<p>If you've got any queries about 
Bejeweled 2 or the registration process, first

itself, please get in touch with us at the email address at the top of this
page.</p>

<h2 class='docHeading'>How to Play</h2>
<P>Bejeweled 2 uses the same classic gameplay from Bejeweled with a few unique twists, and of course the addition of some explosive new game modes!</P>

<P>For those new to the Bejeweled phenomenon, the premise is simple - the screen will fill with a random arrangement of seven different gem types.  
The aim is to try and make lines (vertical or horizontal) of 3 or more identical gems by swapping pairs of gems.   As you make matches and remove gems, new gems will drop in from above.</P>

<P>Swapping a pair of gems can only occur if the swap will result in a match occurring, if it does not, the gems will return to their original positions.  You cannot swap gems diagonally, only horizontally and vertically!</P>

<P>In Bejeweled 2, making a line of 4 gems will produce a <B>Power Gem</B>.  These powerful gems are left behind, and if used to create a match as normal, will explode, destroying all the gems around them!  
These can be great for making some space in the game board and getting new gems into place.</P>

<P>Making a line of 5 gems is the ultimate in experiences - this creates the rare and powerful <B>Hyper Cube</B>.  Hyper Cubes can always be swapped with a gem, even if the swap would not make a match...the reason for this 
is that when swapped, the Hyper Cube activates, and lightning shoots forth to destroy all the gems of that type on the board!</P><h2 class='docHeading'>Game Modes</h2>
<P>Bejeweled 2 features a host of games modes, from the classic mode we all know and love, to the mind bending Puzzle mode!  There are also several additional game modes that you can unlock as you play the game - can you find them all?</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Classic</h3>
<P>Classic mode is based on the game which started it all, Bejeweled itself.  You have unlimited time to make matches, but if you run out of moves it's game over!  Make careful use of Power Gems and Hyper Cubes to keep the gems flowing!</P>

<P>You can always ask for a hint by tapping on the "?" button in the bottom left, but this will cost you a little of your progress towards the next level.</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Action</h3>
<P>In Action mode, speed is of the essence!  You will always have at least one move available to you, but the timer bar will get progressively faster as time passes.  Make matches quickly to fill the timer bar, and when it reaches the end you will 
progress to the next level!</P>

<P>Requesting a hint in Action mode will cost you a little time from the Timer bar, so keep an eye on it.</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Endless</h3>
<P>As the name implies, Endless mode keeps going forever!  Endless mode will always ensure that you have at least one move available, and there is no way to lose in this mode.  As you progress through the levels, you will collect gems - maybe something special will happen when you have enough?</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Puzzle</h3>
<P>Puzzle mode is very different from the normal Bejeweled modes.  Instead, there will be an arrangement of gems on the screen, and your goal is to make matches to remove all the gems!  This may take several moves and careful planning to achieve!</P><h2 class='docHeading'>Special Gem Types</h2>
<P>The different gem types you will encounter in Bejeweled 2 are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Normal Gems</B> : The normal classic gems, and the mainstay of Bejeweled 2.  Make matches to remove them and score points!</LI>
<LI><B>Power Gems</B> : Power Gems are characterised by a white glow emanating from their centre.  Create these by making a match with 4 identical gems.  They can then be used in another match to create a powerful explosion!</LI>
<LI><B>Hyper Cube</B> : The ultimate in gems, the philosopher's stone.  Hyper Cubes can be created by making a match with 5 identical gems.  Hyper Cubes can be matched with any other gem, and when this is done, will remove all the gems of that type from the board.  
Hyper Cubes can be seen as a multicoloured swirl of energy.</LI>
<LI><B>Rocks</B> : Rocks are unreactive lumps of...rock.  You cannot form matches with Rocks, although they can be swapped around as normal.  To destroy Rocks, use a Power Gem, Time Bomb or Hyper Cube!</LI>
<LI><B>Time Bombs</B> : Time Bombs are black and spiky, with a counter on their front.  As you make matches, this counter will go down.  When it reaches 1, the bomb will start shaking to show that it's about to go off.  The next match you make will cause the bomb to explode, destroying all the gems around it!</LI>
</UL><h2 class='docHeading'>Game Options</h2>
<P>The <B>Tips</B> Game option allows you to determine whether or not to show the dialog boxes containing hints and tips about how to play Bejeweled 2.</P>

<P>The <B>Hint Sparkles</B> controls whether the automatic "hint" system will be active.  If this is enabled (the default), then if you make no move for a few seconds, then a valid move will be indicated by the gem you need to move sparkling.  
Unlike asking for a hint, the automatic hint system will never cost you points/time.</P>

<P>The <B>Transparency</B> slider under the Graphics settings allows you to alter the transparency of the game board.  Setting it to the far left will give a completely transparent board, while the right edge of the slider will produce an opaque board.</P>

<H2 class="docheading">Screensaver Settings</H2>
<P>The <B>Select Screensaver</B> button allows you to change which mode the Screensaver will use from: None, Demo (automated play), and Slideshow (will cycle through the different backgrounds).  Please note that the <B>Slideshow</B> setting does not appear in 
Bejeweled 2 Lite, as the Lite version only has the one background to reduce the filesize and memory requirements.</P>

<P>The <B>Slideshow</B> speed setting allows you to control how quickly the background will switch to a new one in Slideshow mode.</P>

<P>The <B>Select Clock</B> button allows you to set whether the Screensaver clock appears or not (Default: On).  If the clock is enabled, it will appear in the top right corner, and allow you to move it around the screen by dragging it with the stylus!  
You can also use the ">" button to advance the Screensaver to the next screen (either a new set of gems, or a new background depending on the mode).  The "X" button allows you to quit from the Screensaver mode and return to the main menu.</P>

<P><B>Start Screensaver</B> allows you to manually start the Screensaver.  You can only use this option while on the title screen, the Screensaver may not be enabled while in-game.</P>


<h2 class='docHeading'>Hidden Features</h2>
<P>Bejeweled 2 features several hidden game modes...</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Original</h3>
<P>Original mode is as the name implies, original Bejeweled with absolutely none of the new special gems.  To unlock it, play Classic mode extensively!</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Hyper</h3>
<P>The speed of Hyper mode defies human description, but otherwise plays in the same way as Action mode.  To unlock it you will need lightning reflexes built up from playing Action mode to high levels.</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Cognito</h3>
<P>Cognito mode is only available to those who can answer every puzzle posed to them!  In Cognito mode, the puzzles are mirrored from their Puzzle mode equivalents, the colours are different and you score points for each move you make!  
Take heed, however: when you ask for a hint in Cognito mode, you will not score any further points for the rest of that puzzle.</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Finity</h3>
<P>Finity mode can be unlocked by the truly tenacious in Endless mode.  In Finity mode, you have a timer bar much like in Action mode, but power gems, rocks and timebombs can drop in from the top as well as normal gems!  
Further, in Finity mode, single matches score no points - only chain reactions (also known as "cascades") will score points!</P>

<h3 class="docheading">Twilight</h3>
<P>To enter Twilight mode, circle the stylus clockwise around the purple mode buttons on the title screen, touching each in turn.  You may need to circle several times before it activates.  Twilight mode is very similar to Classic mode, except that gems 
can fall from both the top and the bottom of the screen!</P>






<h2 class='docHeading'>Registering</h2>

		they can register it either by purchasing a copy from a local store or by
